    "# Disease Mention Detection from Medical Abstracts\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to programmatically collect medical research articles, filter for relevant content, and build a text classification model for disease mention detection. Using COVID-19 as an example, the workflow can easily be adapted to detect mentions of other diseases such as influenza, malaria, or dengue."
